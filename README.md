# LLM-Chatbot-Hub Web Interface

This project is a College Recommendation System developed as part of an academic assignment at C.R. Rao Advanced Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (AIMSCS). It is a multi-language web application that combines a user-friendly chatbot interface (built using HTML and JavaScript) with backend logic written in Python and Java. The system is designed to interact with users and guide them in selecting suitable colleges based on their preferences and input. It demonstrates integration across frontend and backend technologies, offering both interactivity and intelligent decision-making capabilities.

##  Description

The project demonstrates:
- 🔹 A simple chatbot-style user interface
- 🔹 Web development using raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- 🔹 Logic implementation using both Python and Java
- 🔹 A modular file structure to explore backend/frontend separately

It was built as an academic prototype — potentially for C.R. Rao AIMSCS or similar coursework.
