# LLM-Chatbot-Hub Web Interface

This project is a lightweight demonstration of integrating frontend design with backend logic using multiple programming languages — **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java**. It features basic chatbot interactions, static webpage templates, and algorithmic code snippets.

##  Description

The project demonstrates:
- 🔹 A simple chatbot-style user interface
- 🔹 Web development using raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- 🔹 Logic implementation using both Python and Java
- 🔹 A modular file structure to explore backend/frontend separately

It was built as an academic prototype — potentially for C.R. Rao AIMSCS or similar coursework.
